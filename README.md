# WP-AppKit Foundation Demo Theme

This WP-AppKit theme is based on the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> Front End Framework.

# Installation
**WP-AppKit plugin install**

* Download WP-AppKit: https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-appkit
* Install WP-AppKit as you would do for any other WordPress plugins (ie. drop the plugin folder in */wp-content/plugins*)
* Activate WP-AppKit using the _Plugins_ WordPress admin panel. (Browse the *Installed Plugins* list and click the *Activate* link of WP-AppKit.)
* Now you should have a brand new */wp-content/themes-wp-appkit* folder (yes, this is where app themes are stored)

**Foundation theme install**

* Create a new folder "foundation" in the */wp-content/themes-wp-appkit* directory
* Download the Foundation theme from this repository and drop the source files to your "foundation" folder
* **OR** clone this repository in your "foundation" folder : "git clone https://github.com/mleroi/wpak-theme-foundation ." (don't forget the final dot so that it's not cloned in a subfolder!)
* In WordPress, use the *WP-AppKit* admin panel to create a new app and choose the Foundation theme in the *Appearance* box
* From there you're free to test in your browser (using the Chrome's Emulation Mode) or directly try to compile and run on your device.
